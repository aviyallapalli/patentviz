A path predicting circuit is in communication with a system vehicle and the pedestrian detection system. The path predicting circuit processes information from the system vehicle and pedestrian detection system to predict the path of the system vehicle and detected objects. The path predicting circuit is in communication with a path collision circuit and the predicted paths are mapped on the path collision circuit so as to determine if the system vehicle may possibly collide with a detected object.",

Thus, the current limit threshold can be set according to an accurate drain-to-source voltage Vds at a small current sink that is less than a maximum current that ATE is able to provide.

During the switch from the first total light pattern to the second total light pattern, the illumination range of at least one headlamp on the first side of the center axis is first reduced to at least such an extent that it is less than the distance to the detected road user, the second total light pattern being produced subsequently.",

In an exemplary embodiment, the method compares an actual acceleration of the vehicle to an expected acceleration while the vehicle is under the control of an automated acceleration event. The difference between these two acceleration values, along with other potential input, may then be used to approximate the actual mass of the vehicle in a way that takes into account items such as passengers, cargo, fuel, etc. Once an accurate vehicle mass estimate is generated, the method may make this estimate available to other vehicle components, devices, modules, systems, etc. so that their performance can be improved.",
